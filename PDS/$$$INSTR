              INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING CATCLR3

This is just from trying to use CATCLR3.  It seems that
CATCLR3 has two operating modes:  RUNTYPE=T or RUNTYPE=anything.else

You might as well set anything.else equal to D.

So, if you run CATCLR3 with RUNTYPE=T, the syntax would be:

TSO CATCLR3 T catalog.name.unquoted

And the result would be something VERY SIMILAR to the output
of MCNVTCAT (from old IBM CBIPO packaging), or RCNVTCAT, which
is a REXX exec on CBT File 542.

However, RUNTYPE=D produces far different output.

The syntax for RUNTYPE=D would be:

TSO CATCLR3 D catalog.name.unquoted

And the output of this run would be a bunch of DELETE dataset NOSCRATCH
statements for all datasets that are cataloged in the catalog, for
which the volume is not mounted, or which cannot be found.

This type of run will clean up the catalog entries, to make sure
that all entries point to datasets that are "really there".

The output of each type of run is a set of datasets:

Suppose the catalog you are looking at, is called MVSUSER.USERCAT.
Then the output of CATCLR3, with RUNTYPE=T would be:

       prefix.MVSUSER.USERCAT.CNTL
       prefix.MVSUSER.USERCAT.PDS
       prefix.MVSUSER.USERCAT.RPT
       prefix.MVSUSER.USERCAT.SYSPRINT

And the output of CATCLR3, with RUNTYPE=D would be:

       prefix.MVSUSER.USERCAT.CNTL
       prefix.MVSUSER.USERCAT.SYSPRINT

Best of luck with this.  It is a very nice and helpful REXX.
