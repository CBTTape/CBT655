The JCL to start the process is CATCLRJC.txt
   You'll have to change the EXEC libraries in the JCL, the
   output file name, and supply your master catalog name in the
   MASTCAT symbolic.  Review for "??" to customize for your site.

REXX EXEC CATCLJCL is the first EXEC.
   This EXEC scans your master catalog looking for every user
   catalog in it.  It builds a JCL file that will build a PDS
   that includes a PROC and a JOB for every user catalog found in
   your master catalog.  Review for "??" to customize for your
   site.

REXX EXEC CATCLR3 is the second EXEC.
   This EXEC scans a specific user catalog looking for disk file
   catalog entries that do not exist on disk.  The EXEC builds a
   file of IDCAMS DELETE ???  NOSCRATCH statements to be input
   into an IDCAMS step.

   No deletes are done internally in this process.  It basically
   identifies the files fitting the profile (cataloged but do not
   exist) and generates IDCAMS statements that you can choose to
   run or not run at your discretion.

   Customize the JOB in member CATCLRJC.txt and run it.  The
   output file is an IEBUPDTE JOB.  Review this JOB.  As long as
   you adequately customized the CATCLJCL EXEC, this should be
   ready to run.  The PDS built will contain a member for each
   user catalog found in your master catalog.  The member names
   are based on the last node of your usercat names.  If you have
   any catalogs whose last node is identical, you should edit the
   IEBUPDTE JOB to make any duplicate unique.

   That's about it.  Let me know if you have any problems using
   it.

   Thanks,
       Dave K.
